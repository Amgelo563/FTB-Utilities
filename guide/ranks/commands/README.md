* `/ranks add <name> [parent]` - Creates a new rank with optional parent
* `/ranks delete|del <rank>` - Deletes a rank
* `/ranks set <player> <rank|none>` - Sets or removes player's rank
* `/ranks get [player]` - Prints player's rank
* `/ranks get_permission|getp <player> <permission>` - Prints permission value for the specified player
* `/ranks set_permission|setp <rank> <permission> <value|none>` - Sets permission for rank
