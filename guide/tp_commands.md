There are few commands that you can use to teleport as player from FTBU:

* Homes
	* `/sethome [name]` - Creates a home
	* `/home [name]` - Teleports you to a home
	* `/home list` - Lists all your homes
	* `/delhome [name]` - Deletes a home
	* [name] is optional for multiple homes, 'home' is used if it's blank
* Warps
	* `/setwarp <name>` - Creates a warp
	* `/warp <name>` - Teleports you to a warp
	* `/warp list` - Lists all warps
	* `/delwarp <name>` - Deletes a warp
* `/back` - Teleports you to your last death location. It only works once by default, so you can't use this as another home to cheat
* `/spawn` - Teleports you to world's spawnpoint

You can also bind a key to 'Warps GUI' in Controls, and while in-game, pressing it will open Warps GUI, from which you can choose home, warp, back location or spawn with one click.
